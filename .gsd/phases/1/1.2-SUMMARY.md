# 1.2 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Configure Database Connection:** Implemented `api/config/db.js` with `mongoose.connect()` using the `DB_URI`. Modified `api/server.js` to execute `connectDB()` upon startup when `DB_TYPE === 'mongodb'`.
- **Mongoose Entity Schemas:** Created schemas corresponding to RFP for 6 core entities (`Usuario`, `Rol`, `Postulante`, `Puesto`, `Titulo`, `Portal`) injecting `uuidv4` as primary identifiers, audit fields (`createdAt`, `deletedAt`, etc.), string trimming, and logical delete defaults (`deleted: false`).
- **Base Repository & User Repository:** Built a `BaseRepository` interface explicitly throwing errors. Implemented `MongoRepository` that executes generic CRUD operations overriding to consider the `deleted: false` constraint. Connected it to `UsuarioRepository` taking Mongoose model via dependency injection. Prepared `repositories/index.js` for switching between PostgreSQL and MongoDB depending on environmental config.

## Verifications run
- `grep "mongoose.model" api/models/*.js` validated schema existence.
- Local tests for finding created schemas successfully.
- Code structurally confirmed according to `db.js`.
