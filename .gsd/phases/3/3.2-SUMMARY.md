# 3.2 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Multer Configuration & Storage Service:** Installed `multer`. Implemented `StorageService.js` handling the recruitment directory lifecycle (creation, renaming, valid file checks, etc.) as per RFP standards. 
- **File Upload Integration:** Integrated `multer` into `postulantes.routes.js` and updated `PostulanteController` to bridge model data with filesystem operations. Added automatic directory renaming when applicant core data is updated.

## Verifications run
- Checked `StorageService.js` for blocked extensions (`.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`).
- Verified `PostulanteController` correctly calls `renameApplicantDirectory`.

## Next steps
- Plan 3.3: Implement File Retrieval and cleanups.
