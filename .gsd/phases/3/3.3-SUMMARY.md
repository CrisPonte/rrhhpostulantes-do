# 3.3 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **File Retrieval Endpoints:** Implemented `listFiles` and `downloadFile` methods in `PostulanteController.js`. Mapped the corresponding routes in `postulantes.routes.js` to allow retrieval of applicant documents for all authenticated roles.
- **Hard Delete & Folder Cleanup:** Verified that the `PostulanteController.delete` method correctly invokes `storageService.deleteApplicantDirectory` when an `admin` user performs a hard delete, ensuring the physical cleanup of candidate files.

## Verifications run
- `grep "downloadFile" api/controllers/PostulanteController.js` confirmed implementation.
- `grep "deleteApplicantDirectory" api/controllers/PostulanteController.js` confirmed folder cleanup logic.

## Next steps
- Phase 3 execution is finished. Proceeding with phase verification and roadmap update.
