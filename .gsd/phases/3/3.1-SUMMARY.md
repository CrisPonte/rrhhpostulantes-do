# 3.1 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Postulante Repository implementation:** Created `PostulanteRepository.js` with a specialized `search` method to handle complex filtering criteria defined in the RFP. Registered the repository in the factory.
- **Postulante Controller & Routes:** Implemented `PostulanteController.js` and `postulantes.routes.js` with CRUD operations and RBAC protection. Mounted the routes in `server.js`.

## Verifications run
- `ls api/repositories/PostulanteRepository.js` confirmed file existence.
- `grep "/api/postulantes" api/server.js` confirmed route mounting.

## Next steps
- Plan 3.2: Implement Storage Service and File Management.
