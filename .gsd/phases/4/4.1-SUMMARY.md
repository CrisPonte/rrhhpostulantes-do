# 4.1 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Init React Project:** Initialized project in `web/` using Vite with React template. Installed `react-router-dom`, `axios`, and `lucide-react`.
- **Install Tailwind CSS:** Installed Tailwind CSS v4 and the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. Configured `vite.config.js` and `index.css`.
- **Folder Structure & Base Layout:** Created core folder structure (`pages`, `components`, `hooks`, `layouts`, `context`, `services`). Implemented a premium `DashboardLayout.jsx` with top navigation.

## Verifications run
- `web/package.json` contains all required dependencies.
- `web/vite.config.js` correctly includes the Tailwind 4 plugin.
- `web/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx` follows the requested design aesthetic.

## Next steps
