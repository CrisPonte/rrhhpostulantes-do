# 4.2 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Auth Service & Context:** Created `auth.service.js` for API interaction and `AuthContext.jsx` for global state management.
- **LoginPage & PrivateRoute:** Implemented a high-quality `Login.jsx` with loading states and error handling. Developed `PrivateRoute.jsx` to enforce authentication before accessing dashboard pages. 

## Verifications run
- Routes in `App.jsx` are wrapped in `AuthProvider`.
- `PrivateRoute` correctly redirects to `/login`.
- Login form uses absolute positioning and icons from `lucide-react` for premium feel.

## Next steps
- Plan 4.3: KPI Dashboard with Chart.js.
