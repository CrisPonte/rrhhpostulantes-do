# 5.2 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Advanced Filter Form:** Built `SearchFilters.jsx` to parse user queries across name, ID, province, and dynamic relationships (titles/positions).
- **Data Grid & PostulantesList Page:** Implemented `PostulantesList.jsx` bridging the API search filters with a responsive Tailwind HTML table. It incorporates RBAC logic, hiding or revealing the "Delete" and "Create" options based on the authenticated user's role (Admin / Jefe).
- **Wiring:** Hooked up the component to the main routing system in `App.jsx`.

## Verifications run
- Support data dynamic dropdowns populate seamlessly.
- Table handles empty, loading, and populated states correctly.
- Hard/Soft delete actions are correctly gated for Admins and non-Admins.

## Next steps
- Plan 5.3: Postulante Form & Document Management.
