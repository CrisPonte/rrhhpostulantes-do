# 5.3 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Postulante Details Form:** Constructed a comprehensive, modular applicant form (`PostulanteDetail.jsx`) dividing inputs cleanly into `PersonalInfo.jsx`, `StudiesInfo.jsx`, and `InterviewInfo.jsx`. Mapped dynamic array constraints (Provinces, Genders, Interview States) identically to Mongoose schemas.
- **File Management UI:** Developed the `FileManager.jsx`. This component restricts file uploads for new (unsaved) applicants, prevents executables locally before passing to the API, and lists currently saved files with native download interactions.

## Verifications run
- Lint checks passed using React Hooks dependency standards.
- `PostulanteDetail` conditionally renders saving/loading indicators and splits responsibilities.
- The route `/postulantes/:id` mounts the profile view perfectly.

## Next steps
- Phase 5 is fully executed. Proceeding to finalize verification and update project state.
