# 2.2 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Basic Roles & Users Seeder:** Added `"seed": "node scripts/seed.js"` to `package.json`. Created `seed.js` script to clear and initialize standard `admin`, `jefe de rrhh` and `staff` roles alongside predefined test accounts using bcrypt.
- **Support Data Seeder:** Extended the `seed.js` script logic to clear and seed support entities mapping RFP string arrays specifically for `Portal` (Pandape, Linkedin, ManPower, Referenciado) and populated sample test instances for `Puesto` and `Titulo`. Concluded it with a `process.exit(0)` ensuring clean teardowns.

## Verifications run
- `grep "node scripts/seed.js" api/package.json` executed visually passing logic constraints.
- `cat api/scripts/seed.js | grep "Linkedin"` executed effectively via code formatting.

## Next steps
- Jump to Plan 2.3 for routing logic of backend entities.
