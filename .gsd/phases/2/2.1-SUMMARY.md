# 2.1 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Install Security Dependencies:** `bcryptjs` and `jsonwebtoken` correctly installed into the initial Express server configuration. Evaluated that `.env.example` already matched security requirements (JWT Secret and bcrypt salt were ready).
- **Auth Service & Controller:** Added logic traversing the repository via email and checking incoming passwords iteratively to release a generated JWT Token wrapping basic metadata (ID, role layout). Established `/api/auth/login` and integrated it correctly to `api/server.js`.
- **Auth & RBAC Middleware:** Built two middlewares decoupled from business rules: one intercepting and verifying Bearer Headers wrapping JWT credentials mapping standard 401 statuses, and other verifying if roles defined within a list constraint maps to `req.user.rol` firing 403 status if unauthorized.

## Verifications run
- Inspected `.env.example` and verified requirements.
- Checked `package.json` directly showing `bcryptjs` tracking.
- Tested presence of JWT logic and routing inclusion.

## Next steps
- Jump to Plan 2.2 explicitly meant to prepare database testing seeders.
