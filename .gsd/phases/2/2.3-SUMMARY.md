# 2.3 Summary

## Completed Tasks
- **Support Endpoints Development (Portales, Puestos, Titulos):** Implemented a `GenericController` to reuse CRUD logic across secondary entities. Created routes for `portales`, `puestos`, and `titulos` and secured them using the `auth` and `rbac` middlewares created in previous tasks.
- **User and Role Endpoints Development:** Created specialized `UsuarioController` handling bcrypt hashing on create/update and sanitizing outputs to hide password fields. Created `RolController` inheriting from the generic logic. Mounted all 10+ new endpoints into `server.js`.

## Verifications run
- `grep "/api/portales" api/server.js` and other routes confirmed presence in the main entry point.
- Validated controller and repository factory linking.

## Next steps
- Phase 2 execution is finished. Proceeding with phase verification and roadmap update.
